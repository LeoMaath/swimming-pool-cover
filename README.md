# swimming-pool-cover
 a solution that doesn't take valuable space near the pool
 the goal is preventing heat to disappear when air temperature is lower than water temp
 just a cover is not sufficient, an insulating cover is needed
 the best insulating compound is air at rest
 the thickness of air at rest in the cover determines the insulation value
 an air layer should not exceed a height of 10 ? mm as to prevent air circulation
 air at rest such as in glass or rock wool is kept ay rest in a structure of fibers and vacancies
 such a structure is extensive to store
