# swimming-pool-cover
 A solution that doesn't take valuable space near the pool.
 The goal is preventing heat to disappear when air temperature is lower than water temp.
 Just a cover is not sufficient, an insulating cover is needed.
 The best insulating compound is air at rest.
 The thickness of air at rest in the cover determines the insulation value.
 An air layer should not exceed a height of 10 ? mm as to prevent air circulation.
 Air at rest such as in glass or rock wool is kept ay rest in a structure of fibers and vacancies.
 Such a structure is extensive to store.
